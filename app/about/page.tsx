In the field of art work I focus mainly on illustration (drawing, comics, visual reportages and collages). In my work I am inspired by motives that are spontaneously coming to me in my daily life, in nature and lately also in my dreams. I am not searching an universal visual style. I am more interested in finding new ways how to see and record the reality with the simple instrument of drawing.
